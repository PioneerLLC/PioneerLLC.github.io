This is why septic systems in Alaska need to be pumped more aggressively than in the lower 48.</p>\n<p>This product is meant for someone who is responsible for a private septic tank, but not responsible for a public waste water treatment system. The product converts semi-solids into liquids so the contents can pass through the septic tanks baffle.</p>\n<p>Although that sounds baffling (pun intended), this can cause irreparable harm to your septic system because it will clog up the pores of the soil. Once the porous nature of the field is clogged, it will not work properly and will progressively fail from then on. </p>\n<p>In a city with a wastewater treatment plant this is not a problem, as the sewage is treated by chemicals and filtration, dissemination, and a whole list of mechanisms to make the wastewater capable of being disposed of properly.
