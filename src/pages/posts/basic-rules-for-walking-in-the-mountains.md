We have launched our new ordering website, but please feel free to email or call us directly for any of your needs.

Pioneer Engineering will continue to provide well and septic inspection services for the foreseeable future and will be complying with the latest order from Alaska's Governor entitled "ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE" dated March 27, 2020 as per Part vi. "Essential Businesses", sub items 7 & 10 as follows:

7. Plumbers, electricians, exterminators, and other service providers who provide services that are necessary to maintaining the safety, sanitation, and essential operation of residences and critical infrastructure.

20. All other businesses that can maintain Social Distancing Requirements (defined below) and prohibit congregations of no more than 10 people in the business at a time (including employees).

Item 7 applies since we are a service provider for residences and item 20 applies since all of our testing will be performed outside of occupied residences. If we need to interface with residents, we will maintain strict social distancing. We will perform flow testing from pressure tanks only in vacant residences.

We'll get through this everyone!


We are doing testing as needed!
